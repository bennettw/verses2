added passages model and linked it up to verses, but i'm thinking that's stupid

why not just have a passage? it stores the reference, and can make just one api call to look up the 
verse. i can add in verse later so i can correlate and see which passages overlap, but that's more
complicated and not core functionality

Passage
  Date discovered
  Text
  Notes/comments
  User

and that's it.

Next:
  flesh out passage, and add in API fetching 
  OR
  add users and associate them with passage
